# Requirements Document: TodoMVC App

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The TodoMVC application is a simple task management app where users can:

- Add new todo items
- Mark them as complete/incomplete
- Filter items by their status
- Edit or delete tasks
- Clear completed tasks

This document outlines the functional requirements for the app.

## âœ… Functional Requirements

### 1. Add Todo Item

- User can enter text into an input field.
- Pressing `Enter` adds a new todo item to the list.
- New item should appear at the bottom of the list.
- Input field should clear after submission.

### 2. Display Todos

- All todo items are shown in a list.
- Each item includes:
  - A checkbox for marking complete/incomplete
  - The task label (text)
  - A delete ("X") button that appears on hover

### 3. Complete / Incomplete Todo

- Clicking the checkbox toggles the itemâ€™s state between active and completed.
- Completed items should appear with strikethrough styling.
- The number of active items is updated in the footer.

### 4. Delete Todo

- Hovering over a todo item reveals a delete (Ã—) button.
- Clicking it removes the item from the list permanently.

### 5. Edit Todo

- Double-clicking a todo label turns it into an input field.
- Editing the text and pressing `Enter` saves changes.
- Pressing `Escape` cancels the edit.
- If the input is cleared and saved, the item is deleted.

### 6. Filters

- The app displays three filters at the bottom:
  - All
  - Active
  - Completed
- Selecting a filter updates the list:
  - **All**: shows every item
  - **Active**: shows only incomplete items
  - **Completed**: shows only completed items
- The currently active filter should be visually indicated.

### 7. Clear Completed

- A "Clear completed" button is shown only when there are completed items.
- Clicking it removes all completed todos from the list.

### 8. Toggle All

- A checkbox in the header allows toggling all items complete/incomplete.
- Toggled state should reflect on all items.

## ðŸ’» Non-Functional Requirements

- **Responsive**: The app must be usable on standard desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Accessible**: Buttons and inputs should be accessible via keyboard.
- **Performance**: Operations (add, delete, toggle) must feel instantaneous (<100ms delay).

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios Coverage (Future Use)

Can be mapped to:

- **Test Case Generators**: Based on each requirement
- **Test Code Generators**: For UI interaction automation
- **NLP Test Creation**: Derivable from this document
- **Visual AI**: For ensuring layout consistency
- **Autonomous Testing Agents**: To explore interactions
